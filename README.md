ABSTRACT: 
Automation is the use of control systems and information technologies to reduce the need for human work in the production of goods and services. Automation plays an important role in the world economy and in daily life. Home automation is called a smart home or smart house. A home automation system will control lighting, climate, entertainment systems, and appliances. It may also include home security such as access control and alarm systems. When connected with the Internet, home devices are an important constituent of the Internet of Things. A home automation system typically connects controlled devices to a central hub or "gateway". The user interface for control of the system uses wall-mounted terminals, tablet or desktop computers, a mobile phone application, or a Web interface, that may also be accessible off-site through the Internet. There are lot more devices available in the market for home automation but that need to be configured for each appliance in the home, more over they are not cost effective.  In the proposed system Raspberry pi is used as a main controller which will control all the appliances in the home and touch screen is used as wall-mounted terminals for user interface. The proposed system replaces the old style mechanical switch with touch based switch, surveillance system, and voice over control.
